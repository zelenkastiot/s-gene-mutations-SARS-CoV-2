# s-gene-mutations-SARS-CoV-2
Code for my Bioinformatics project where I analyzed GISAID SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants data and generated a language model using Transformers. The model semantically captures masked glycoprotein amino acid mutations in emerging variants of the SARS-CoV2-virus and gives appropriate scores for each potential aa change.
